![Fractal Zoom](https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-bb01fcc42569.gif)

Project from 61C that generates the Mandelbrot Fractal and lets you zoom in on areas of the graph iteratively.
Makes extensive use of the Mandelbrot Function $$M(Z,C) = Z^2 + C$$, complex numbers, and converting numerical
values to a specified color palette. All main code is written in C.
