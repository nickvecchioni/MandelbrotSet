# Mandelbrot Fractal Zoomer
![Fractal Zoom](https://www.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=13848520651734)

Project from 61C that generates the Mandelbrot Fractal and lets you zoom in on areas of the graph iteratively based on given command-line arguments.
Makes extensive use of the Mandelbrot Function, complex numbers, and converting numerical
values to different color palettes. 

Quite beautiful if I do say so myself. 

All main code is written in C.

Since this is a class project, only some files are provided. Hence, this README does not provide instructions for running the program.
