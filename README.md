# Mandelbrot Fractal Zoomer
![Fractal Zoom](https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-bb01fcc42569.gif)

Project from 61C that generates the Mandelbrot Fractal and lets you zoom in on areas of the graph iteratively based on given command-line arguments.
Makes extensive use of the Mandelbrot Function, complex numbers, and converting numerical
values to different color palettes. 

Quite beautiful if I do say so myself. 

All main code is written in C.
